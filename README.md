# Python Lists Comprehesions

This is the source codew for the repl.it project here: https://repl.it/@JimLynch/Python-List-Comprehesion

This project is meant to be a simple demonstration of Python's "List Comprehensions"

In a nutshell, list comprehensions allow you to write the equivalent of a "for loop" in a clean one-liner.

```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Regular "For Loop" Method
doublesForLoop = []
for x in nums:
  doublesForLoop.append(x * 2)

# List Comprehension Method
doublesListComprehension = [x * 2 for x in nums]
```

Run the code [here](https://repl.it/@JimLynch/Python-List-Comprehesion)!

Notice how in the regular for loop method we first write the looping logic (for x in nums) and then the code to execute for each iteration (x * 2).

Notice how the list comprehension just reverses the order of the two and puts them on the same line!

So, if you didn't fully understand Python's list comprehesions before, hopefully this helps you! abs

Happy coding!
